                    <h2><a id="intro"></a>What is TrueChoice?</h2>
                    <p>TrueChoice is an analytics company that builds web apps and provides data-based consulting for big companies.
                    </p>
                    <p> We build two kinds of apps for our clients:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Dynamic surveys that quantify employee/business partner's preferences so that our clients can better meet the needs of the people they work with. The final product is preference data and actionable insights for our clients.</li>
                            <li>Single-use apps that quantify a potential customer's preferences and use these preferences to recommend a product from a Client's vast catalog. The final product is a quick survey that can have up to double the close rate of traditional product filters.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>Both kinds of apps leverage our core analytics to deliver personalized experiences to our users and provide data-driven feedback to our clients. A few more bits of context:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TO DO: I feel like all this can be dispersed throughout the piece.</li>
                        <li>The apps match — or feel like a natural extension of — our clients' brands.</li>
                        <li>All our apps are built on top of a proprietary frontend framework we call "Platform".</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                    <p>We build responsive web applications that run on any device. But the mobile breakpoints have never gotten the attention they need — content doesn’t always fit well; widgets that make sense on desktop don’t map well to mobile; answering survey questions takes too many clicks and too much scrolling. A complete mobile redesign is daunting though, and it hadn’t been done since the team first designed our mobile screens many years ago.</p>
                    <p>The content of the survey determines how effective the insights to the client or the product recommendations to the user are. We work with our clients to make sure the content will yield them the best results possible, but ultimately, they get the final say. And clients are verbose. So, stuff doesn’t always fit. We often run into a situation where there is more information than can fit on the page in mobile, and that’s a problem, because users have to be able to compare all the levels, attributes, tradeoffs, easily.</p>
                    <p>And we were Data-Blind - We have no data, we have hearsay from clients and internal feedback. At the beginning of this project, we had never usability tested our mobile app.</p>
                    <p>We are building with LEGO Bricks of unknown size. That’s why I always design with real content.</p>
