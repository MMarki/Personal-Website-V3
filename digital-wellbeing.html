                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><h3>SUMMARY</h3><p>I applied lessons from a previous project to redesign Google's Digital Wellbeing app. Initial usability tests of the new prototype shows improvements over the current version of the app.</p></div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><h3>ROLE</h3>I was the sole designer on this project. I conducted interviews, usability tests, and a detailed review of Google's Digital Wellbeing app before redesigning the experience.</div>
                    </div>
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Everyone I know spends more time on their phone than they would like to. They find their phones incredibly compelling in the moment but ultimately unfulfilling. So, why do they keep using them so much? It's not a personal failing &mdash; a few software companies are spending  a lot of time and money to make their products as <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3" target="_blank">addictive and manipulative</a> as possible.</p>
                    <p> A couple years ago, I started thinking about whether we can combat software that invades our free time and encourages bad habits with software that respects our free time and encourages good habits. My first experiment was Phree, an anti-phone-addiction app. Although Phree ended up being a dead-end, it encouraged me to examine higher-level solutions to the problem, and ultimately led to a redesign of Google's Digital Wellbeing app. I recommend you read through the <a href="phree.html" target="_blank">Phree summary</a> before reading this case study, since I will be comparing the two approaches.

                    <p><em>I do not work for Google, and I don't have access to the same data they do. It's possible that with more data or a better understanding of the team's constraints, I would understand their design decisions differently. I am not suggesting that my design is the be-all and end-all of designs for the Digital Wellbeing app.</em></p>
                    <h2><a id="research"></a>Research &amp; Personas</h2>
                    <p> I started on Phree by interviewing my peers to better understand their experiences with their phones. I combined and simplified their experiences into three personas, which you can see below.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/Phree%20Personas.jpg" alt="Personas">
                        <figcaption>Personas</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p> Each persona has a good reason to use their phone, but struggles to regulate their usage. Annie wants to surf the web at certain times a day but not others. James wants to free himself from the malicious investment mechanics of mobile games but still have something fun to do when he's bored. Charlotte wants to be less stressed out by distractions without losing her edge in the workplace. I wanted to design an app with features that would help all of them, so I took these all-too-common worries and broke them down to the root causes:</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Gamification</b> &mdash; It's easy to get drawn back into an experience when you have incomplete tasks. That's why careful gamification will dole out progression along multiple streams and always leave something for you to do next time you start the app.</div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>No record-keeping</b> &mdash; Time on your phone adds up in tiny increments over the course of the day. But you don't notice unless all the incremental time is recorded and categorized into useful, easy-to-access data.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Color</b> &mdash; All bright colors are mesmerizing, but we have an especially strong instinctual response to the color red. Red triggers fight-or-flight insinct and makes us feel like we have to respond right away. That's why it's used as a notification color.</div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Contextual usefulness</b> &mdash; Some tools are only useful at certain times of the day, but you have access to them all day long. For example, your work email is useful at 2PM, but is insomnia-inducing at 2AM.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p> Ultimately, I settled on the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metrics that track how much time you spend on your phone each day.</li>
                        <li>A siteblocker to help users regain control over when they use the browser (and individual apps) on their phone.</li>
                        <li>An awards page to reclaim the reward circuitry that has been highjacked by mobile games, snapstreaks, and reactions by giving you awards tied directly to the goals that matter to you.</li>
                        <li>The ability to switch off the color on your phone to make it less enticing and make notifications feel less urgent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2><a id="visual"></a>Visual Design</h2>
                    <p>Since the app encouraged users to turn on grayscale, the UI needed to be readable in color or black and white. View the <a href="phree.html" target="_blank">Phree summary</a> for more details on ths project.</p>

                    <h2><a id="revisiting"></a>Revisiting</h2>
                    <p>That's where I left this project for a while. It looked pretty. The research I did was valid. The design used gamification, siteblockers, and a grayscale mode to encourage you to spend less time on your phone. For a while, that was enough. But as I grew as a designer, I kept having the feeling that Phree wouldn't help much. I was dissatisfied with the quality of this work because I had concerns: Would this app, if built, have the permissions over other apps that would be necessary to build a notification and access schedule that fit a user's life? How would it fit into the ecosystem of a phone's OS? Did anyone even want just another app on their phone?</p>
                    <p>The conclusion I came to is that the most robust solution to this problem comes not from a single app with a suite of tools, but from many tools and settings supported at the OS level.</p>
                    <p>There <em>are</em> individual apps that are doing interesting work in this space, such as <a href="https://inthemoment.io/" target="_blank">Moment</a> and <a href="https://www.unglue.com/" target="_blank">unGlue</a>, and that's a solid route to go if you can't work closer to the operating-system level. Since this was all exploratory anyway, I wanted to revisit this project with more experience to discover what the most high-impact solution would look like.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page-half img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/where-to-solve.png" alt="You solve phone addiction at the O.S. level.">
                    </figure>
                    <p>Google and Apple have started to work within their own ecosystems to solve phone addiction with Digital Wellbeing at Google and Screen Time at Apple.</p>
                    <p>I have an Android phone, and use a couple of the Digital Wellbeing tools available. But, while reviewing their offerings as research into existing solutions, I discovered that their tools had a lot of room for improvement. So, I decided to tackle phone addiction at the OS level by building on the Android ecosystem's existing Digital Wellbeing tools.</p>
                    <h2><a id="reviewing"></a>Reviewing Android's Digital Wellbeing Offerings</h2>
                    <p>The Digital Wellbeing app was hard to find. Using search on an Android phone surfaces relevant apps, but it won't surface Digital Wellbeing. To find the app, I did a general Google search to figure out that the app is buried in Settings, and there's a toggle on the bottom of the app's home page to make the app show up in Search and the App List. Why is finding this thing so hard? I can't think of a good reason to build something useful like this and then hide it away. Healthy phone use should not be opt-in!</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/orig-home.png" alt="There are many tools available, but only a few are part of the Digital Wellbeing app.">
                        <figcaption>There was room for improvement in other areas besides discoverability.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>There were other areas worth improving as well, like the Dashboard.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/orig-dashboard.png" alt="There are many tools available, but only a few are part of the Digital Wellbeing app.">
                        <figcaption>Not a bad approach, but is a diagnostic-based approach best for motivating users?</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>A web search for Digital Wellbeing won't take you to the app; it'll take you to the <a href="https://wellbeing.google/" target="_blank">Digital Wellbeing website</a>, which is a mostly informational site that tells you about the kinds of tools Google offers to improve your relationship with your phone. You can take the survey to assess your own tech pain-points; then Google will recommend customized tips for you; then you can click on these tips, which take you to an Android Help page; then you go back to your phone (assuming you did this on your laptop like I did), go into the Settings menu, and, depending on what offering it is, you go to a different sub-menu; then you finally get access to this one feature. Do these features have to be so fragmented? Why is the survey exclusive to the website? Why is it not the onboarding to the app?</p>
                    <p>Here is the list of the tools on the site:</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/tools.png" alt="There are many tools available, but only a few are part of the Digital Wellbeing app.">
                        <figcaption>There are many tools available, but only some are part of the Digital Wellbeing app.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h2><a id="interview"></a>Interviews</h2>
                    <p>I interviewed four iPhone users and four Android users to understand how people used their phones and whether their usage had been changed by the presence of Screen Time and Digital Wellbeing. I wanted to compare Screen Time's adoption with Digital Wellbeing's. All iPhone users knew about Screen Time, and no Android users knew about Google's Digital Wellbeing offerings.</p>
                    <p>The Digital Wellbeing app is having a slow rollout. It's only on Pixel and a few other phones. The only tool Android users consistently know about and use is "Do Not Disturb", which is in the Quick Settings pulldown menu &mdash; very visible, not like the other tools.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    ... define &ldquo;distracting&rdquo;.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Regardless of what kind of phone they had, there are some things that all interviewees had in common: they have a few core apps that account for most of their wasted time; some of the stressful or addicting apps are utilities like Gmail, Messenger, and social media apps for people working in advertising or for nonprofits (as one interviewee said, &ldquo;define distracting.&rdquo;); they have trouble cementing new phone habits.</p>
                    <h2><a id="principles"></a>Principles</h2>
                    <h3>Progress-Focused</h3>
                    <p>I was dissapointed that Google didn't have a clear view of my progress as part of the Digital Wellbeing dashboard. The current dashboard is still a useful thing to have, but it's more of a daily snapshot that lets you zoom in and view your usage by day and by app. It's nice that they tie these usage statistics to an action immediately by letting you set timers as soon as you see how much time you're losing.</p>
                    <h3>Unified Toolset</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to bring as many OS-level tools under a single umbrella as possible. What goes in and what stays out? It's a tough question. Google's Digital Wellbeing offerings are scattered, and we need to unify them, but some offerings, like tools specifically for Youtube, Chrome, and Pixel Stand should probably stay separate.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/feature-list.png" alt="Feature list">
                        <figcaption>Feature List</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>There are two features that are not separate products but were still left out of the app. The first is Snooze Notification, which should be on by default. Based on our principle that healthy phone use should not be opt-in, you shouldn't have to allow notification snoozing.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page-half img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/snooze.jpg" alt="Feature list">
                        <figcaption>Currently you have to turn on notification snoozing.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The second feature is Switch off Work for work profiles. This was a fun feature to learn about. According the Android Enterprise team, work profile &ldquo;separates work apps and data on an Android device from personal apps and data.&rdquo; The ability to turn off your work profile, and all the apps and notifications tied to it, is a feature I was thinking of pulling into the Digital Wellness app. But the point of the Digital Wellness app is to improve discoverability for these features, and the option to turn off your work profile was already discoverable, and only one gesture away.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page-half img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/work-profile.png" alt="Feature list">
                        <figcaption>In Android 10, Users can turn off work profile from the app search menu with one tap.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Granularity Where it Counts</h3>
                    <p>The tool should be granular enough to work with real people's real lives. The big opportunity here was Focus Mode. My research shows that users only have a few apps that use up most of their time, and that many of these apps are contextually useful based on the time of day, whether they're at work or not, whether they're spending time with family, etc. So, I made the decision to trade off the ability to mass-set a schedule, for the ability to set app-specific schedules that work with real people's needs.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/schedule.png" alt="Schedule">
                        <figcaption>Schedule should be more granular.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h2><a id="design"></a>UI Design</h2>
                    <p>With the principles of "Unified Toolset", "Progress-Focused", and "Granularity Where if Counts" established, I began working on the new features for the app: My Progress, Achievements, Improved Focus Mode, App Onboarding, Wind-Down-independent-Grayscale, and Flip to Shhh. </p>
                    <h3>Sketches</h3>
                    <p>I like to sketch before I start working in a high-fidelity tool. My sketches helped me be efficient when I jumped into Adobe XD, and helped me define what changes I'd be making to the sitemap. </p>

                    <p>Your Progress is front and center. It shows you the information that's most important when you're trying to build a new habit: how much better are you doing and how close are you to achieving your goals?</p>

                    </figure>
                    <h3>Focus Mode</h3>
                    <p>I redesigned Focus Mode to make it more accomodating to a user's real life. Sometimes we need to use an app for work, sometimes we want to use it for fun, and sometimes we need to hide it because it's distracting us from other work. Now users can set a schedule for each app, so even if you need a distracting app for work, you don't have to turn off the blockers on all the other distracting apps on your phone.</p>

                    <h3>Onboarding</h3>
                    <p>I adopted the survey from the website into the app as an onboarding experience. After the user fills out the survey, the links go directly to the relevant screens in the app instead of to a long list of instructions. Achievements are reordered to prioritize the ones that match a user's needs.</p>

                    <p>Finally, I built a prototype in XD showing the new features and information architecture for the app. Feel free to play around with it and let me know what you think!</p>
