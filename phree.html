                    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                    <p>Everyone I know spends more time on their phone than they would like to. They find their phones incredibly compelling in the moment but ultimately unfulfilling. So, why do they keep using them so much? It's not a personal failing &mdash; a few software companies are spending  a lot of time and money to make their products as <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">addictive and manipulative</a> as possible. A couple years ago, I started thinking about whether we can combat software that invades our free time and encourages bad habits with software that respects our free time and encourages good habits. With this idea in mind, I began experimenting on Phree, an anti-phone-addiction app. As I continued iterating on the project, I found a bunch of ways to fail at fixing phone addiction, and one way that might actually work.
                    </p>
                    <h2><a id="research"></a>Research &amp; Personas:</h2>
                    <p> I started by interviewing my peers to better understand their experiences with their phones. I combined and simplified their experiences into three personas, which you can see below.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/Phree%20Personas.jpg" alt="Personas">
                        <figcaption>Personas</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p> Each persona has a good reason to use their phone, but struggles to regulate their usage. Annie wants to surf the web at certain times a day but not others. James wants to free himself from the malicious investment mechanics of mobile games but still have something fun to do when he's bored. Charlotte wants to be less stressed out by distractions without losing her edge in the workplace. These personas have complicated and realistic needs. You probably feel similar to at least one of them, because our phones are loaded with apps that are specifically designed to use color, notifications, and reward schedules to keep us coming back. I tried to take these all-too-common worries and break down the root causes of phone addiction.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Gamification</b> &mdash; It's easy to get drawn back into an experience when you have incomplete tasks. That's why careful gamification will doll out progression along multiple streams and always leave something for you to do next time you start the app. This is called the Zeigarnik effect</div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>No record-keeping</b> &mdash; Time on your phone adds up in tiny increments over the course of the day. But you don't notice unless all the incremental time is recorded and categorized into useful, easy-to-access data.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Color</b> &mdash; All bright colors are mesmerizing, but we have a strongest instinctual response to the color red. Red triggers fight-or-flight insinct. That's why it's used as a notification color.</div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Contextual usefulness</b> &mdash; Some tools are only useful at certain times of the day, but you have access to them all day long. For example, your work email is useful at 2PM, but is insomnia-inducing at 2AM.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p> Ultimately, I settled on the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metrics that track how much time you spend on your phone each day.</li>
                        <li>A siteblocker to help users regain control over when they use the browser (and individual apps) on their phone.</li>
                        <li>An awards page to reclaim the reward circuitry that has been highjacked by mobile games, snapstreaks, and reactions by giving you awards tied directly to the goals that matter to you.</li>
                        <li>The ability to switch off the color on your phone to make it less enticing and make notifications feel less urgent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2><a id="visual"></a>Visual Design:</h2>
                    <p>Since users are likely to turn off the color on their phones, the UI needed to be readable in color or in greyscale. See below for examples of the UI in grayscale and in color.</p>

                    <h2><a id="revisiting"></a>Revisiting:</h2>
                    <p>That's where I left this project for a while. It looked rather pretty. But I didn't think it was going to help much. The app used gamification, siteblockers, and a grayscale mode to encouraged you to spend less time on your phone. But I had concerns: Would this app, if built, give a user the permissions over other apps that would be necessary to build a notification and access schedule that fit their life? How would it fit into the ecosystem of a phone's OS? Did anyone even want just another app on their phone?</p>
                    <p>Ultimately the most robust solution to this problem comes not from a single app with a suite of tools, but from many optional tools and settings supported at the OS level.</p>
                    <p>There are individual apps that are doing interesting work in this space, such as <a href="https://inthemoment.io/blog">Moment</a> and <a href="https://www.unglue.com/">unGlue</a>, and that's a solid route to go if you don't work for Apple or Google. Since this was all exploratory anyway, I wanted to revisit this project with more experience to discover what the most high-impact solution would look like.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page-half img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/where-to-solve.png" alt="You solve phone addiction at the O.S. level.">
                    </figure>
                    <p>I doubt that Apple and Google's designers intended phones to be this disruptive, this manipulative. It probably emerged by accident, but that doesn't remove the moral imperative to dial back the addictive properties. You can see some anti-phone-addiction approaches start to emerge as Digital Wellbeing at Google and Screen Time at Apple.</p>
                    <p>I have an Android phone, and use a couple of the Digital Wellbeing tools available. But, their offerings were lackluster (how?). So, I decided to tackle phone addiction at the OS level by building on the Andoid ecosystem's existing Digital Wellbeing tools.</p>
                    <h2><a id="reviewing"></a>Android's Digital Wellbeing Offerings:</h2>
                    <p>The Digital Wellbeing app was hard to find. Search on an Android phone surfaces relevant apps, but it won't surface Digital Wellbeing. To find the app, to do a general google search to figure out that the app is buried in Settings, and there's a toggle on the bottom of the page to make the app show up in Search and the App List. Why is finding this thing hard? Do they not think phone addiction is a big deal? Are they not proud of the work? I can't think of a good reason to build something useful like this and then hide it away. Healthy phone use should not be opt-in!</p>
                    <p>A web search for Digital Wellbeing won't take you to the app; it'll take you to the <a href="https://wellbeing.google/">Digital Wellbeing website</a>, which is a mostly-informational site that tells you about the kinds of tools Google offers to improve your relationship with you phone. It has a survey that you can take to assess your own tech pain-points. It'll recommend tips for you. Then you can click on these tips, and they take you to a set of instructions, the you go back to you phone, go into the settings menu, then depending on what offering it is, you go to a different sub-menu, then you finally get access to this one feature. Does it have to be this distributed? Why is the survey exclusive to the website? Why is this not the onboarding to the Digital Wellbeing app?</p>

                        <figcaption>There are many tools available, but only a few are part of the Digital Wellbeing app.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Talk about the app itself:</p>
                    <p>Options are pretty limited for these tools</p>
                    <p>Radial  graph is hard to read for many items.</p>
                    <p>What am I doing vs. what are they doing?</p>
                    <h2><a id="interview"></a>Interview:</h2>
                    <p>I interviewed 3 iPhone users and 3 Android users to understand how people used their phones and whether their usage had been changed by the presence of these tools. I wanted to compare Screen Time's adoption with Digital Wellbeing's. All iPhone users knew about Screen Time, and no Android users knew about Google's Digital Wellbeing offerings.</p>
                    <p>The Digital Wellbeing app is having a slow rollout. It's only on Pixel and a few other phones. The only tool Android users consistently know about and use is "Do Not Disturb", which is in the Quick Settings pulldown menu &mdash; very visible, not like the other tools.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    Define &ldquo;distracting&rdquo;.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Regardless of what kind of phone they had, there are some things that all interviewees had in common: they have a few core apps that account for most of their wasted time; some of the stressful or addicting apps are utilities like gmail, messenger, and social media apps for people working in advertising or for nonprofits; they have trouble cementing new phone habits.</p>
                    <h2><a id="principles"></a>Principles:</h2>
                    <h3>Unified Toolset</h3>
                    <p>Bring all OS-level tools under a single umbrella. What goes in and what stays out? good question. Tough question. Google's Digital Wellbeing offerings are so scattered, so we need to unify them, but some offerings, like tools specifically for Youtube, Chrome, etc. should probably stay separate.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/feature-list.jpg" alt="Feature list">
                        <figcaption>Feature List, also, pixel stand</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Some features that are missing from the full google list: Snooze notification - should be on by default. You shouldn't have to allow notification snoozing.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page-half img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/snooze.jpg" alt="Feature list">
                        <figcaption>Snooze</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Also, work profile. This was a fun feature to learn about. I didn't know much about how this one worked. According the Android Enterprise team, work profile "separates work apps and data on an Android device from personal apps and data." The ability to turn off your work profile, and all the apps and notificaitons tied to it, is a feature I was thinking of pulling into the Digital Wellness app. But the point of the Digital Wellness app is to improve discoverability for these features, and turning off your work profile was already super easy.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page-half img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/work-profile.png" alt="Feature list">
                        <figcaption>Turn off work profile from the app search menu with one tap.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Progress-Focused</h3>
                    <p>I was dissapointed that google didn't have a clear view of my progress as part of the Digital Wellbeing dashboard. The current dashboard is still a useful thing to have, but it's more of a daily snapshot that lets you zoom in and view your usage by day and by app. It's nice that they tie these usage statistics to an action immediately by letting you set timers as soon as you see how much time you're losing.</p>
                    <h3>Granularity</h3>
                    <p>The tool should be granular enough to work with real people's real lives. There are tradoffs we're making here. For Focus Mode, we're trading off the ability to mass-set a schedule, but my research shows that users only have a few apps that use up most of their time, and that many of these apps are contextually useful based on the time of day, whether they're at work or not, whether they're spending time with family, etc.</p>
                    <figure>
