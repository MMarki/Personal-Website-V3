                    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                    <p>Everyone I know spends more time on their phone than they would like to. They find their phones addictive but ultimately unfulfilling. So, why do they keep using them so much? It turns out that software companies spend a lot of time and money making sure that their applications are not just compelling and exciting, but <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/">addictive and manipulative</a>. It makes sense that we can combat software that invades our free time and encourages bad habits with software that respects our free time and encourages good habits. With this idea in mind, I began experimenting on Phree, an anti-phone-addiction app.
                    </p>
                    <h2><a id="research"></a>Research &amp; Personas:</h2>
                    <p> I started by interviewing my peers to better understand their experiences with their phones. I combined and simplified their experiences into three personas, which you can see below.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/Phree%20Personas.png" alt="Personas">
                        <figcaption>Personas</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p> Each persona struggles with a different aspect of phone addiction. Annie wants to surf the web at certain times a day, James wants to free himself from the malicious investment mechanics of mobile games, and Charlotte wants to ignore the constant barrage of colorful notifications. Our phones are loaded with apps that are specifically designed to use color, notifications, and reward schedules to keep us coming back. Our phones are portals to the entire internet and we have them in our pockets all day long. I tried to reflect these concerns in the personas, and my solutions reflect the needs of the personas in turn.</p>
                    <p> Ultimately, I settled on the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A graph for tracking how much time you spend on your phone each day.</li>
                        <li>A siteblocker to help users regain control over when they use the browser on their phone.</li>
                        <li>An awards page to reclaim the reward circuitry that has been highjacked by mobile games and snapstreaks.</li>
                        <li>The ability to switch off the color on your phone to make it less enticing and make notifications feel less urgent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2><a id="branding"></a>Visual Design:</h2>
                    <p>Since users are likely to turn off the color on their phones, the UI needed to be readable in color or in greyscale. See below for examples on the UI in grayscale and in color.</p>
