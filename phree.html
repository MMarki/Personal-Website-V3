                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Everyone I know spends more time on their phone than they would like to. They find their phones incredibly compelling in the moment but ultimately unfulfilling. So, why do they keep using them so much? It's not a personal failing &mdash; a few software companies are spending  a lot of time and money to make their products as <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3" target="_blank">addictive and manipulative</a> as possible. A couple years ago, I started thinking about whether we can combat software that invades our free time and encourages bad habits with software that respects our free time and encourages good habits. With this idea in mind, I began experimenting on Phree, an anti-phone-addiction app. Phree also laid the groundwork for me to expand my thinking on how to solve phone addiction, which led to my <a href="digital-wellbeing.html" target="_blank">Digital Wellbeing redesign</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2><a id="research"></a>Research &amp; Personas</h2>
                    <p> I started on Phree by interviewing my peers to better understand their experiences with their phones. I combined and simplified their experiences into three personas, which you can see below.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Phree/Phree%20Personas.jpg" alt="Three personas">
                        <figcaption>Personas</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p> Each persona has a good reason to use their phone, but struggles to regulate their usage. Annie wants to surf the web at certain times a day but not others. James wants to free himself from the malicious investment mechanics of mobile games but still have something fun to do when he's bored. Charlotte wants to be less stressed out by distractions without losing her edge in the workplace. I wanted to design an app with features that would help all of them, so I took these all-too-common worries and broke them down to the root causes:</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Gamification</b> &mdash; It's easy to get drawn back into an experience when you have incomplete tasks. That's why careful gamification will dole out progression along multiple streams and always leave something for you to do next time you start the app.</div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>No record-keeping</b> &mdash; Time on your phone adds up in tiny increments over the course of the day. But you don't notice unless all the incremental time is recorded and categorized into useful, easy-to-access data.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Color</b> &mdash; All bright colors are mesmerizing, but we have an especially strong instinctual response to the color red. Red triggers fight-or-flight insinct and makes us feel like we have to respond right away. That's why it's used as a notification color.</div>
                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><b>Contextual usefulness</b> &mdash; Some tools are only useful at certain times of the day, but you have access to them all day long. For example, your work email is useful at 2PM, but is insomnia-inducing at 2AM.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p> Ultimately, I settled on the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metrics that track how much time you spend on your phone each day.</li>
                        <li>A siteblocker to help users regain control over when they use the browser (and individual apps) on their phone.</li>
                        <li>An awards page to reclaim the reward circuitry that has been highjacked by mobile games, snapstreaks, and reactions by giving you awards tied directly to the goals that matter to you.</li>
                        <li>The ability to switch off the color on your phone to make it less enticing and make notifications feel less urgent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2><a id="visual"></a>Visual Design</h2>
                    <p>Since the app encouraged users to turn on grayscale, the UI needed to be readable in color or black and white.</p>

                    <h2><a id="influence"></a>Influencing Future Projects</h2>
                    <p>That's where I left this project for a while. At first, I was statisfied with Phree as a quick exploration of an anti-phone-addiction app. Over time, I started wondering how effective this solution would actually be, and whether there was a way to better tackle the problem of phone addiction. This line of thinking ultimately led to my redesign of Google's Digital Wellbeing app.</p>
